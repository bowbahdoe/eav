* Might make sense to use CapnProto as the format for storage of the Beta-epsilon tree
* Not a direct translation from EDN, but bound to be fast
* Can still spend the first phase of things dumping raw EDN

* So components to do

- Storage of index chunks
- Indexing datoms
- Modeling datoms for indexing
- Querying datoms
- Datalog for coming up with query plans
- Transactor
- Transaction Functions
- Embedded Peer
- HTTP Api
